# Exercises

This week you are to look at the different ways that you can run a PHP file on your system.

Although it doesn't matter what you use for this course, there are some tools that you should not use when you go out to industry.

Your task this week is to run the following code inside of an **index.php** file in your browser using each of the discussed systems.

```
<?php
  echo "<h1>Hello PHP World!";
?>
```

If you choose a particular system and do not test all 3 of them, that is ok - but be aware that you understand the pro's and con's of each of them.

## THE CLI

Regardless of what option you use, you will need to get comfortable with the Command line tool as they are used to run Git commands and Compose commands.

You should know about Git from a previous class, or else there is a link to a quick course on Moodle in the **Useful Links** section.
