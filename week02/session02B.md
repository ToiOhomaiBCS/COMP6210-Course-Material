Work on your assessment, based on what you have learned in the previous session.

By know you should have read through the case studies and selected the one you want to use for your project.

Your task for this class is to setup a list of all the things you have to do for assignment. 

In the assessment you will find some key things that you must complete, but there are also things you need to do so that you can accomplish those things.

Make an exhaustive todo list and break them up in a weekly sections so you can discuss them with your tutor each week.
