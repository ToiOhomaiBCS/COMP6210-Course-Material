# Revision

Previously you have learned HTML and CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

In this session we are going to have little revision to help you along the way for the first assessment where you will be given the task to create HTML and CSS templates.

First of if you don't know any HTML or CSS - or you have forgotten it all, watch these videos:

## In class demo

In class we are going to build a simple website that uses HTML5 semantic tags and CSS grid.

We will also make use of a framework, so you can leverage some UI components.

Note the code for this demo does directly require "web server" but it will be best to set it up and used to using the right practice.
