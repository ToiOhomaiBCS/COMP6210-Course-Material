# Case Study 01

## The Story:

The students at Toi Ohomai have a student rep for each class and twice a semester there are student rep meetings where the feedback from the students have an official platform to reach the management of the faculty. During the semester the students may want to give some feeback that can be collated and passed on on during at these meetings. Students also need to have a platform where they can discuss and vote on topics. The students that have the student rep role will be able to moderate the posts on the platform and giver feedback from the meetings.

## Design Details:

Toi Ohomai is an exisiting brand and has specific colours and logo's that need to be used. You can find more information about that in the brand guideline document [here](assets/Toi-Ohomai-Brand-Guidelines.pdf).

## Goals:

This website will need to have the following pages and requirements:

* Welcome page, with a description of what the site is about
* Rules and Regulations page
* Login / Register page
* Once logged in, students are presented with a list that shows all current topics
* Students can create a new post, but once submitted this needs to be approved by a student rep first.
* Student rep replies will be highlighted so that they stand out.

* Needs to be mobile responsive
* All students can register using their student id and make up their own password 
* Username must only be numbers, so staff can't login.
* Students can get the student rep role set by an administrator
* Administrator can modify and delete ANY POST
* Student reps can only "hide" posts
* Posts by students need to be approved by a student rep before they are visible to the other students.
* Design must be consistent on each page

## Files supplied:

* Sketched Wireframes with a rough design layout, you are free to make minor changes to these
* ERD of the database that needs to be created
