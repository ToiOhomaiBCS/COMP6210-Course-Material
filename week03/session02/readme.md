# Creating a template page

Let's have a look at how an api works and how we can pull in data.

You will need to know how to do this for your project.

[https://github.com/to-jk11/three-apis](https://github.com/to-jk11/three-apis)

We will use [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) as the theme for the website.

The outcome of this exercise is that you will see that HTML is used for the markup of the page only - not the content.

The content will be pulled in from 3rd party sites by using their API.

Understanding this process is vital for the preperation of your assignments.

In this class we are going to make a website that uses 3 API's and populate it with some data.
