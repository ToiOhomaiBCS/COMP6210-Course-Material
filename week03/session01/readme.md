# Client side scripting

## Introduction to Javascript

Javascript is used for adding dynamic features to your website and all of this processing is done in the client's browser.

## Javascript Documentation

Although Javascript is a programming language in its own right, we won't have to start from scratch. A lot of the things you can do in JavaScript should look familiar to you already.

Let's have a look at some basics by looking on the official mozilla documentation site.

* [Hello World](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#A_hello_world_example)

* [Basic Programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)

* [Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

## Some Other Javascript Resources

Just like any language, there are some things that are more unique to JavaScript that may not be so straight forward in other languages. 

If you want to get better at doing Front End Development, the following resources are a good start.

* High order functions => [Higher-order functions - Part 1 of Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&t=223)

## What about JQuery?

Jquery was created to do a lot of the things that javascript now does out of the box with ES6. There will still be some legacy code around and JQuery will also still be used in some animations. But with new projects and libraries around the use of it will go down.
