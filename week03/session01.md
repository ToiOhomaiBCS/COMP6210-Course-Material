## Introduction to Javascript

Javascript is used for adding dynamic features to your website and all of this processing is done in the client's browser.

## What about JQuery?

Jquery was created to do a lot of the things that javascript now does out of the box with ES6. There will still be some legacy code around and JQuery will also still be used in some animations. But with new projects and libraries around the use of it will go down.
